Welcome to the traditional HelSec Summer park hangout!

**WEATHER UPDATE: CURRENTLY IT LOOKS THAT IT WILL RAIN AROUND 18-19. IN THAT CASE WE WILL MEET AT THE PARK AND MOVE TO A BAR THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON HELSEC INSTAGRAM STORY**

As usual during summer, we are having a more unformal meetup.
It's more about getting together, mingling and having a good time.
Event is Bring Your Own Beverages this time.

17:00 - Gathering in Ruttopuisto (Old Chuch Park) & seeing where it goes

❗️ If the weather looks bad, we might either cancel the meetup or move it to another location indoors
