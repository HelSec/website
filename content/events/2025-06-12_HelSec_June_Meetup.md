ðŸ”· **Mikael Nilsson** - Mikael Nilsson works as the Product Security Lead for Customer Intelligence R&D at SAS Institute Inc. He collaborates with various teams within SAS to help design & implement secure SDLC practices to meet the ever evolving threat landscape and also works with customers to ensure SAS security practices align with customer expectations. His main focus is around the security & privacy aspects of SAS Customer Intelligence 360, a global multi-tenant marketing Software-as-a-Service solution. Outside of work he is a serious casual video gamer, likes Japanese cars & is known to sample different beers wherever he may roam.

ðŸ”· **Niko KivelÃ¤** - Niko KivelÃ¤ works as the Head of DevOps at SOK. Niko's mission is to help others; teams, individuals, and businesses succeed better and operate more efficiently. With 20 years of experience in the entire software lifecycle; from coding to building teams and from test automation to the transformation of several iconic companies, where he has been at the heart of digital development. In the business world, no change happens locally, but it must happen holistically from inside out and top to bottom. Niko's technical background and experience in presenting are strongest when forming teams, developing practices, facilitating workshops, coaching teams, and continuous deployment to continuous services.

ðŸ”· **Ben Gladnikoff** - Ben Gladnikoff is the Country Representative and a senior analyst at Look Closer, a leading advisory firm in integrity due diligence and complex investigations. He has over 15 years of experience in the intelligence field, including a decade in private intelligence firms managing OSINT and HUMINT operations across multiple regions. His work has included leading teams of analysts and human intelligence specialists with backgrounds in national intelligence services. With experience working for threat actors, Ben now helps companies protect themselves against the same capabilities he once deployed. Private intelligence mirrors the methods of state actors and organised crime, and the threat from all three is growing. His work focuses on helping organisations recognise and defend against targeted information gathering, insider recruitment, and reputational attacks.
