Spring is finally here, and what better way to celebrate the season than by spending some quality time with your fellow HelSec members at a movie night! As our last movie night was unfortunately canceled earlier in the year, we're happy to announce a new try on this awesome event. This time, we'll be watching Sneakers together!  
(We also have a backup movie, in case we don't get the license in time: Blackberry)

Join us on Tuesday, April 29th, from 18:30 to 21:00 for a fun evening at Cinema Orion. We will be watching the movie together at Cinema Orion, which we have rented just for us. 

📅 When? Tuesday 29.4., 18:30-22:00?  
📍 Where? Cinema Orion, Eerikinkatu 15 (Kamppi)  
🎬 Doors open at 18:30, movie starts at 19:00?  

**Registration is done through HelSec ticketing system, found [here](<https://events.helsec.fi/helsec/pceld/>).**  
**Members have a link to the member ticket shop in their e-mail**
**Registration opens on 16.4. at 18:00**

If your plans change, please remember to cancel your ticket so that another HelSec member can grab your seat. This also helps us plan better and ensures no one misses out on the fun!
