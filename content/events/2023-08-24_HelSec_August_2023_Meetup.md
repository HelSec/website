 Speaker bios:

 🔷 TBA

 🔷 Jan Staf – Head of OT cyber security, Reformo Networks  
Jan has been working with networks since he graduated in the early 90’s. The interest for security started due to 911, but the passion for security on networks grew whilst he lived in Africa and the Middle East. Ever since he moved back to Finland in 2012 the main part of his work has been securing OT network environments. Free time is spent with family, summertime sailing whenever possible.

 🔷 Jukka Springare – Director of Storytelling, Reformo Networks  
Jukka has always been enthusiastic about cyber security, although his path to interesting OT security discussions and presentations has not necessarily been a classic one. Passion for solving problems is always the key motivator for him. For the past 10 years he has been helping customers to find the right solution for their cyber security needs. He fills his free time by commentating on American football and playing golf, frisbee golf and eSports.
