His background is in electrical engineering, embedded devices and test automation. Combining his background with the hobby in hacking lead to a natural career shift to cybersecurity. In his free time, Bug Bounties and CTFs keep Aapo motivated and learning, but he is more interested in developing the tools and making the challenges than actually solving them.
