**\*\*THIS IS THE RE-ORGANIZING OF THE POSTPONED WORKSHOP FROM OCTOBER. FIRST OPTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS TO EARLIER WORKSHOP. SLOTS WILL BE OPENED IN CASE THERE ARE CANCELATIONS.\*\***

 **Introduction to Ghidra and Firmware Reverse Engineering.**

 This is an entry level workshop that serves as an introduction to ghidra in the context of hardware firmware reverse engineering. We will be using a multi timezone clock as the case study. The clock uses a MC-48 series microcontroller from the seventies that is quite simple and easier to understand than modern processors.

 Reading the first 40 pages of [<https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf](https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf>) or the start of the MCS-48 users manual should give enough starting information to understand the system. The MCS-48 Users manual in particular has a really good section about how a (simple) processor works.

 **Please install ghidra ([<https://ghidra-sre.org/](https://ghidra-sre.org/>)) beforehand and make sure it runs on your system.**

 For OSX users it is recommended to use 'brew' for installing and also install 'gradle' and then in console go to homebrew\_base/Caskroom/ghidra//ghidra-/Ghidra/' and execute 'gradle buildNatives' to get locally signed versions of the native extensions.

 **The outline of the workshop will be:**

 1. **A short presentation on the hardware**  
2. **Guided setup of the ghidra project**  
3. **Guided tour of the main ghidra features**  
4. **Reverse engineering the firmware in small groups**

 * **Few hints will be provided as the workshop progresses**

 5. **At the end we will go through the program and what it does**

 The event will be hosted at Elisa premises in Pasila.  
Participants will need to provide their full name for Elisa's visitor registration.
