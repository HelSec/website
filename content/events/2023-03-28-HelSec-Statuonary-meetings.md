It's time to have our official statutory spring and fall meetings of 2022 (yes, you read it right) on Tuesday 28th of March at 17:00 (EET).

The meetings will be hybrid:
* Attending in-person: Smith & Mill & Kotler, Technopolis Ruoholahti, Hiilikatu 3, 00180 Helsinki
* Attending virtually: Zoom (instructions sent to members)

Would you like to become a member of the board at HelSec Ry? Or would you like to be president/vice-president of HelSec? Join the meeting and step up, or just come and vote your favorite. The meetings will also agree how much the membership will cost for 2023 and decide, if the rule change can be made. Every vote matters! The meetings will be held in Finnish but every member is more than welcome.

The full meeting agendas has been sent to all registered members on 8th of March. If you haven't received your invite, don't hesitate to contact us: contact [at] helsec.fi

See you in the meetings!
