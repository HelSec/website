 **Speaker bios:**  
ðŸ”· Juho Jauhiainen - Juho is an experienced DFIR expert but that has nothing to do with this speech. In 2018, Juho started planning to set up HelSec together with Osku and the first meetup took place in January 2019. Until the end of 2023, Juho has contributed to HelSec's board but will now take a back seat.  
The speech is also a farewell to the running of the organisation, at least for the time being.  
ðŸ”· Joona Hoikkala - TBA  
ðŸ”· Joakim Tauren - CISO, Small Business Segment, Visma. Dad, fly fisher, hobby wood worker, aspiring communicator. Helping companies in Visma to make better security decisions every day.
