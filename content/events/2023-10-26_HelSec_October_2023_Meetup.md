 Speaker bios:

 üî∑ Rayyan Hassan : Security Consultant at Fraktal  
An electrical engineer turned cybersecurity specialist. It was my interest in IoT security that first brought me to cybersecurity and I haven't looked back since. In this vast domain, my interests are particularly geared towards AI research, and its effect on the current security domain. In my free time I enjoy socialising with friends, reading novels and exploring different ways of combining my engineering experience with cybersecurity.

 üî∑ Elias Alanko: Currently CISO at 3stepIT.  
Past in the Finance industry in various security, and fraud prevention roles since early 2010s.In addition, advisory roles at Europol‚Äôs EC3 and European Commission. Expert witness in fraud related trials. Fraud prevention enthusiast, especially in the areas of online banking and corporate fraud. Master of Finance by education, Behavioural Finance to be exact, so somewhat of an outlier in the Infosec community.
