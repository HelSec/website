Welcome to the CitySec Xmas Party  

This event is powered by **HelSec & Accenture**.  

We are gathering together to celebrate the past year and upcoming holidays for a bit different sort of meet-up, a huge party. We will begin with presenting visiting CitySec chapters and few words from the hosts, but after that we let music do the talking.  

Coat charge has been covered & there will be some amount of food & beverages available for the hungriest & thirstiest, but when the freebies run out, they run out.  

If your plans change, please remember to cancel your ticket so that someone on the wait list can grab your spot.

## Artist bio:

🔷 **DJ Pappa Ben Talar & DJ Young Cilantro** team up for a B2B session that blends seasoned swagger with fresh-cut flavor. Their styles snap together like perfectly synced packets, serving a set that’s equal parts groove, grit, and green-tinted zest. It’s the kind of pairing that makes the dancefloor feel like it just discovered a new favorite algorithm.  

🔷 **Business City** - Speed, pams and meatmug. Lubricant, pole and snow cannon. For those who dig fast doups, big sound and good tyckitting.
