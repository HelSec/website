Let's spend a fun night solving HackTheBox challenges & boxes together :)

 Prerequisites:  
- get an invite to the hackthebox.eu platform. How?? Nobody talks about it.  
- prepare and bring your hacking laptop (with Kali, probably) and make sure your hackthebox VPN setup works.

 This meetup is sponsored by Sanoma. Food & drinks will be served.
