Welcome to the HelSec September meetup!

This event is powered by **WithSecure**.

***ATTENTION - UNFORTUNATELY THIS MONTH'S EVENT IS ALREADY FULL AS WE ARE USING OUR OWN TICKETING SYSTEM. INFORMATION WAS POSTED IN OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS. HELSEC BOARD IS SORRY FOR NOT POSTING THE EVENT FOR MEEETUP MEMBERS EARLIER AND WE WILL MAKE SURE TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE.***

Weâ€™re excited to invite you to the HelSec September meetup on Thursday, September 25th!
This evening is going to be a little different from your usual meetup: first, weâ€™ll have insightful talks from **Ismayil Hasanov** and **Arkadii Dubinin**.
After that, weâ€™ll head over to explore **WithSecureâ€™s Museum of Malware Art**: a fascinating, one-of-a-kind collection that dives into the history (and future) of cyberattacks, and what they mean for all of us.

**Important**: To join the Museum of Malware Art tour during the meetup, you must also register separately via the link given in the event ticket.

If your plans change, please remember to cancel your ticket so that someone on the wait list can grab your spot.
