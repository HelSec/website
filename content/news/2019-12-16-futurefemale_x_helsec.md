HelSec is teaming up with Future Female and Nixu to organize a 6-month training program for women who are interested in working in cyber security or maybe for those already working or studying in this industry but still want to gain deeper knowledge.

<!--summary-->

Currently there is a global shortage of professionals in the cyber security industry â€“ both male and female. The aim for this program is to enable and empower the women in this field and to attract and find future talent.

You can find more information and the application from [Future Female website](https://www.futurefemale.com/news/future-female-x-helsec-cyber-security-essentials/)
