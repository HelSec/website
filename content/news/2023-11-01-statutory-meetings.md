**All of our members all more than welcome to join the meeting on 15th of November at 17:00 (EEST)**. 

The meetings will be hybrid: at Technopolis Ruoholahti (Hiilikatu 3) and Google Meet participation is also possible. The meetings will be held in Finnish, as required by law but every member is more than welcome. Would you like to become a member of the board at HelSec Ry? Or would you like to be president/vice-president of HelSec?

Join the meeting and step up, or just come and vote your favorite. The meetings will also agree how much the membership will cost for 2024 and decide, if the rule changes can be made.

Every vote matters!

P.S. We know we're (again) super late with these - let's arrange the 2024 spring meeting before end of April.
