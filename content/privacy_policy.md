We contact you only in important matters such as the annual membership fee or any upcoming events, statutory meetings etc. 

## Sharing Your Information

Upon registering for official meetups, our support members may require a list of participants in advance for security reasons, to know who is in the building during the meetup.

Some of your accounting and financial records are processed and stored by third-party service providers. In our case, we use Netvisor and an accounting firm to manage these records on our behalf. These third parties handle your information strictly for the purposes of accounting and compliance with legal obligations, and we ensure that they adhere to appropriate data protection standards.

Other than that, we do not share your information with anyone outside the HelSec board and a few trusted volunteers. These volunteers work in our support team and they help you regain access to your HelSec account should you have any issues.
